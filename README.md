# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The Credit Risk Analysis attempts to evaluate credit risk of customers using six different machine learning models. The algorothms that are used in this analysis are: 
- Cluster Centroids Undersampling
- Combination Sampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Native Random Oversampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifer

With the latter being bias reduction models. Following the results, each supervised learning algorithm's accuracy levels as well as F-scores were compared to determine the best algorithm to use for the given credit risk dataset.
